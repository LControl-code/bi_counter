# BI Counter - Binary Search File Counter

🚀 **High-performance file counting system using binary search optimization for Windows network drives**

A modern burn-in tier advancement tracking system designed for production environments with 100k+ files per directory. Features O(log n) performance optimization, web-based approval interface, and automated email notifications.

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Core Optimization

- **Binary Search Algorithm**: O(log n) complexity vs O(n) traditional scanning
- **Single Directory Enumeration**: Bulk timestamp collection instead of individual file stats
- **Network Drive Optimized**: Designed for Windows filesystem with proper timezone handling
- **Performance Target**: 130k files processed in ~1 second vs ~30 seconds traditional methods

### Key Components

- **`main.py`**: Core binary search file counter with production optimization
- **`approval_interface.py`**: Modern web-based dashboard for quality management
- **`config_wizard.py`**: Interactive configuration wizard for production deployment

## 📊 Performance Comparison

| Method                     | File Count | Processing Time | Throughput             |
| -------------------------- | ---------- | --------------- | ---------------------- |
| Traditional O(n)           | 130,000    | ~30 seconds     | ~4,300 files/sec       |
| **Binary Search O(log n)** | 130,000    | **~1 second**   | **~130,000 files/sec** |

- **Bootstrap Mode Options**: Choose between fresh start or historical file inclusion
- **Email Configuration**: SMTP setup for automated notifications
- **Device Management**: Enable/disable devices, set tiers, configure exclusions

### Sample Configuration

```json
{
  "scan_path": "Q:\\Production\\Data",
  "production_settings": {
    "is_production": true,
    "production_start_date": "2024-01-01T00:00:00",
    "bootstrap_mode": false
  },
  "devices": {
    "EOE18011069": {
      "enabled": true,
      "current_tier": "24h",
      "production_start_date": "2024-01-15T08:00:00",
      "exclude_2h": false
    }
  },
  "tier_requirements": {
    "24h_to_12h": 250,
    "12h_to_6h": 500,
    "6h_to_3h": 1000,
    "3h_to_2h": 2000
  }
}
```

## 🔄 Tier Advancement Workflow

1. **File Counting**: Binary search algorithm counts new files since last scan
2. **Requirement Check**: Compares count against tier advancement thresholds
3. **Approval Request**: Creates approval request when threshold is met
4. **Email Notification**: Sends notification to Quality team (if enabled)
5. **Device Pauses**: Device stops counting until approval decision
6. **Web Approval**: Quality team uses web interface to approve/reject
7. **Tier Advancement**: Approved devices advance to next tier, count resets

### Tier Progression

- **24h** → **12h** (250 units)
- **12h** → **6h** (500 units)
- **6h** → **3h** (1000 units)
- **3h** → **2h** (2000 units)
- **2h** = Final tier

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Configuration Not Found**

```bash
❌ Config file config.json not found
Available config files:
  - config_production.json
```

Solution: Specify config file: `python main.py config_production.json`

**Permission Denied**

```bash
❌ Permission denied accessing \\network\path
```

Solution: Verify network drive permissions and credentials

**Email Not Sending**

```bash
❌ Failed to send email: Authentication failed
```

Solution: Check SMTP credentials and server settings in configuration

**Web Interface Not Loading**

```bash
❌ Error loading approval interface
```

Solution: Check Flask dependencies and port availability (8080)

### Performance Issues

- **Slow Network**: Verify network drive connectivity and speed
- **Large File Sets**: Monitor memory usage, consider pagination for very large directories
- **Concurrent Access**: Ensure exclusive access during scanning periods

## 📈 Monitoring & Metrics

### Key Performance Indicators

- **Scan Duration**: Target <2 seconds for 100k+ files
- **Memory Usage**: Should remain stable across runs
- **Error Rate**: Monitor for network/permission issues
- **Approval Response Time**: Track quality team response times

### Log Analysis

```bash
# View today's logs
tail -f logs/bi_counter_binary_config_production_20241201.log

# Performance metrics
grep "BINARY SEARCH PERFORMANCE" logs/*.log

# Error tracking
grep "ERROR" logs/*.log
```

## 🚀 Optimization Highlights
